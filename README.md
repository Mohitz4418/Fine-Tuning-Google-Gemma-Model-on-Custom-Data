# Fine-Tuning-Google-s-Gemma-Model-on-Custom-Data
This project showcases how to fine-tune Google's Gemma language model on a custom dataset using Hugging Face's ecosystem (transformers, datasets, trl, peft, accelerate) and efficient 4-bit quantization with bitsandbytes.

🚀 Overview
Fine-tuning large language models can be costly and resource-intensive. This project demonstrates how to fine-tune Gemma using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) with LoRA and quantization-aware training for efficient GPU usage.

🧠 Key Features
Uses Google's Gemma via Hugging Face Transformers

Fine-tuning with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) using the peft library

Memory-efficient 4-bit quantization using bitsandbytes

Trainer based on SFTTrainer from Hugging Face TRL

Supports Google Colab with secret-managed API keys or auth tokens

📦 Requirements

Install the required libraries using pip:
pip install -q bitsandbytes==0.42.0
pip install -q peft==0.8.2
pip install -q trl==0.7.10
pip install -q accelerate==0.27.1
pip install -q datasets==2.17.0
pip install -q transformers==4.38.0

🔐 API / Authentication
This notebook uses google.colab.userdata for managing credentials or secrets.

You might be required to add Hugging Face access tokens or Google credentials.

Recommended for Google Colab or Jupyter environments where secret management is supported.
